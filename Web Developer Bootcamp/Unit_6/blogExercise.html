            I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! Big joint, big joint, I'll meet you down at the big joint. George Michael may be suffering from what we in the soft-sciences call Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, or the "OC Disorder." Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we?

            But where did the lighter fluid come from? She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. If I make this comeback, I'll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face. There are dozens of us! Dozens!

            How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? So did you see the new Poof? His name's Gary, and we don't need anymore lawsuits. I'm gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants.

        <p>Leela's gonna kill me. Bender, <span>being God isn't easy.</span> If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>

        <p>And I'm his friend Jesus. File not found. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Soon enough. Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>

        <p>Really?! Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</p>

        <p>Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! What are their names? A true inspiration for the children.</p>

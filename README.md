# About This Project

* This project is primarily a personal repository for my own educational purposes. This is my space to practice learning new concepts in web development. I have been following along with the course: `The Web Developer Bootcamp` created by Colt Steele on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). It's a great course, and I highly recommend it.

* I have tried to stick to the course as much as possible, I have also skipped a few lessons for one reason or another. So please don't use this as a reference/cheat sheet for his course. It won't work.

* I have also added in a few personal tidbits that I allowed me to practice while I was exploring some new concepts, and wanting to elaborate further on some concepts that I learned in this course. This repo will likely be evolving as I continue my education through this course.

* In the future, I plan on taking these concepts, as well as other things I have learned in my time learning Web Development, and creating a more professional and intentionally made portfolio in another project.
